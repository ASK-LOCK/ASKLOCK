Closing thoughts written by all members of our team.
Challenges:
1. There has been little feedback to the past assignments so we were unable to discern if we are going in the right direction.

2. The general Corona outbreak led to a diruption in our organization.

3. Understanding the SDL and any other materials regarding user security. For all three of us this is our first security class.

Surprises:
1. Surprised by no one giving us feedback. There have been multiple assignments yet our current grade and direction of our project is a mystery

2. How hard is it to code hashing into our program.

3. The defualts on some softwares to help us create a secure webservice. Example Meteor.

Important Achievements:
1. We were able to understand animations better for web design.

2. We actually got a hash to work.

3. We started with prototypes to a minorly ready application.

Disappointments:
1. To many
